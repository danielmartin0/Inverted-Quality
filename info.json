    "description": "Quality now consists of negative tiers (positive tiers are removed). Crafting items has a 60% chance to reduce their quality by one tier.\n\nTo cope with the new gameplay, the new Downgrade Port allows high-quality items to be used in low-quality recipes, and the Meltdown Facility allows the melting down of low-quality items back into Normal base materials.",
