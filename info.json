Whenever items are crafted there is a 50% chance to produce lower-quality products than the ingredients.\n\nThree new entities are provided: Downgrade Port allows high-quality items to be used in low-quality recipes; Meltdown Facility allows the melting down of low-quality items back into Nominal-quality base materials; and a Burner Assembling Machine to avoid a softlock in the early-game.",
