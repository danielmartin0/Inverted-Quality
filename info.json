Each time an item is crafted, it has a 90% chance to become more degraded.\n\nThree new entities are provided: Downgrade Port allows low-degradation items to be used in high-degradation recipes; Meltdown Facility allows the melting down of highly degraded items back; and a Burner Assembling Machine to avoid a softlock in the early-game.",
