Crafting items has a 60% chance to reduce their quality by one tier. \n\nTo cope with the new gameplay, three additional entities are provided: the Downgrade Port allows high-quality items to be used in low-quality recipes; the Meltdown Facility allows the melting down of low-quality items back into Normal base materials; and the Burner Assembling Machine avoids a softlock in the early-game.",
